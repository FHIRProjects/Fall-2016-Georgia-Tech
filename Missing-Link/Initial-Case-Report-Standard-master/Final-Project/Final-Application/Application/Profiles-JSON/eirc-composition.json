This document is volume 2 of the 'HL7 CDA R2 Implementation Guide: Public Health Case Report, Release 2' Implementation Guide. The Initial Public Health Case Report Document (eICR) template is a specialization of the US Realm Header (2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.22.1.1:2015-08-01) from v3 of the C-CDA Implementation Guide. It contains all of the constraints of the US Realm Header in addition to constraints specific to initial public health case reporting. It describes the structure and content requirements for the initial Case Report such as document identification, header information, relationships to the eICR required C-CDA section and entry templates and codes systems/value sets.
